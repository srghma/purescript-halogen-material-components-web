                    Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies,
                    with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was
                    the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to
                    build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were
                    four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and
                    this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard
                    for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the
                    beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner,
                    and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no
                    garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in
                    the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could
                    go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty
                    enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by
                    a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder
                    led down into the small, dark hole.

                    When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she

                    Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat
                    country that reached to the edge of the sky in all
                    directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray
                    mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass
                    was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long
                    blades until they were the same gray color to be seen
                    everywhere.  Once the house had been painted, but the sun
                    blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now
                    the house was as dull and gray as everything else.

                    When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty

                    the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they
                    had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were
                    gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now.
                    When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em
                    had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would
                    scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's
                    merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the
